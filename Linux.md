# Linux

## Installation

* Get Ubuntu (recommendation), or any other distribution of your choice.

## Fundamentals

* Learn to use the OS for basic tasks like internet browsing, installing packages etc.
* Start to do things in terminal. This is where admins/developers/devops work. From now on, you'd be able to do all the things of this chapter in the command line interface (CLI).
* Find the materials that will best suit you to fill in the chapters.
* Here you can learn the basics: https://linuxsurvival.com/ 
* Make notes and produce cheetsheats ... whatever that will help you.

### Filesystem
* root
* relative and absolute path(s)

#### Permissions
* `chmod`, `chgrp` commands
* octal (`755`) and explicit syntax (`a+x`)

#### Standard Directories and files
* What is stored in /bin, /etc/, /home/?
* What's the default log directory?
* Where are all the users of the system stored?

### Text Processing

* Basically there is two common editors for the command line. vi - the tough but powerful one for hackers. nano - the simpleton. I recommend vi, but the choice is yours. In any case, you'll be able to use an editor for the CLI well.

## Shell

* It's powerful, in fact it's a programming language on it's own and it is used to create scripts.
